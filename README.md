This fork exists to add rudimentary pin support to kaiauth. To do this, one must edit the js/pin.js file and set the pin variable to a sha256 hash of any number. More detailed instructions are avaiable under Install.

# Install
- Download the latest release and cxtract first kaiauth.zip and then application.zip
- open the js/pin.js file
- look for the line that says `if (sha256(document.getElementById('pin').value) == "ENTER PIN HERE") {` and replace `ENTER PIN HERE` with a [hash](https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/) of your desired four digit pin
  + You can also have a more than four digits. To allow this, look for the line saying `else if (document.getElementById('pin').value.length > 3) {` and change 3 to your pin length-1 (EG. 14 for a fifteen digit pin)
